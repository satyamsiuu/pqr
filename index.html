                        <strong>Dear Bhumika,</strong>
                        <p>
                            10 months huh, it's been a long time since the day we came together after being silly and acting childish, ignorant 
                            and unware about our love for each other but finally on 10th Feb, we came together when the whole wolrd was trying to 
                            put us together , no matter how much we tried to run away from each other at the end it was our destiny to be one with each other.
                            I always loved you for your innocence which came from your childishness and your oppenness towards me. It took no time for me 
                            to fell deeper and deeper for you, the way you laughed, the way you talked and the way you expressed your thoughts were literally everything 
                            for me. Sooner we did have our lovely time together in which we loved each other in every way possible. The person you were was literally 
                            like the character of geet and I was your aditya kashyap, a person who was devoid of feelings and was just living life like a black 
                            and white tv serial as it was going on until out of nowhere my geet came into my life the chatterbox which never stopped talking and always 
                            had something to talk, full of feeling which always felt every feeling to her fullest, the most amazing person I ever met in my life.
